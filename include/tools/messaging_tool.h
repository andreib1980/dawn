/**
 * @brief Start any token-gated messaging driver whose token is now set but which
 *        isn't already registered.
 *
 * Called after the WebUI saves secrets, so adding a Telegram/Discord/Slack bot
 * token starts its driver live without a daemon restart.  Additive only: it
 * never tears down a running driver, so rotating or removing a token remains
 * daemon-restart-to-apply (live teardown would join a long-poll listener and the
 * engine has no clean per-driver unregister path).  Safe to call on any secrets
 * save — already-running drivers are skipped.
 *
 * @note Thread safety: typically called from the lws service thread (set_secrets).
 *       The shared registration state is mutex-guarded, so it is safe even if it
 *       races the one-time init-thread registration.
