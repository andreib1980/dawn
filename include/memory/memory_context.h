/**
 * @brief Build the USER MEMORY block for the cached stable prefix.
 *
 * Constructs a formatted string containing the user's preferences and
 * recent conversation summaries — both session-stable (preferences
 * change only on explicit edits; summaries are fixed once written and
 * the [today]/[yesterday]/[this week] label is constant within a
 * session).  Designed to be appended into the stable_prefix segment so
 * the Anthropic prompt cache attaches.
 *
 * Sections:
 * - USER PREFERENCES: category: value (from memory_preferences, up to
 *   MAX_CONTEXT_PREFS entries)
 * - RECENT CONVERSATIONS: summaries with topics (from memory_summaries,
 *   <= 30 days old, up to MAX_CONTEXT_SUMMARIES entries)
 *
 * Output is bounded by per-item caps internal to the implementation;
 * no per-character budget truncation (the cached prefix has no
 * per-turn token cost).
 *
 * @param user_id User ID to build context for.
 * @param token_budget Deprecated — kept for API stability only.  Ignored
 *                     internally; size is bounded by the per-item caps.
 * @return Heap-allocated NUL-terminated string on success (caller must
 *         `free()`).  Returns NULL when there are no memories to surface
 *         or on allocation failure.  Empty user → NULL (callers can
 *         skip the prompt-augmentation branch cheaply).
