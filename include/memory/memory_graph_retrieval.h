 * @file memory_graph_retrieval.h
 * @brief Entity-graph candidate retrieval for memory.search (Phase 2.b).
 *
 * Parallel candidate source to `memory_fact_search_hybrid()` for cat-3
 * style entity-specific queries — "What country did Jolene buy snake
 * Seraphim?", "Which meat does Audrey prefer?" — where cosine over-
 * broadens on the noun token ("country", "meat") and the gold answer
 * sits at rank 50+.  Closes the LoCoMo cat-3 retrieval gap that
 * remained after the May 2026 shipped retrieval surface.
 *
 * Phase 1A walks fact-linked relations only — relations with non-NULL
 * `fact_id`.  Phase 0 (May 13, 2026) paired-output schema guarantees
 * ~100% fact↔relation linkage on new extractions, so the fact-linked
 * subset is now effectively the full graph for fresh memory.
 *
 * Phase 2 (multi-hop traversal) was scoped, scaffolded, and reverted
 * during the May 14, 2026 session: the 43.8% additional reach measured
 * at hop-2 in the diagnostic turned out to be a measurement artifact
 * of extraction linking facts to peripheral entities, not genuine
 * graph-distance multi-hop questions on LoCoMo.  Production scaffolding
 * was stripped; the design (and the rationale for the strip) is captured
 * in docs/PHASE_2_GRAPH_RETRIEVAL_DESIGN.md.  Phase 2 production code
 * will re-land if a benchmark surfaces genuine multi-hop test cases.
 *
 * Pipeline:
 *   1. Extract proper-noun candidates from the query string.
 *   2. Resolve each candidate against `memory_entities` (canonical names
 *      + aliases).  Discard unresolved candidates.
 *   3. For each resolved seed entity, fan out one hop via
 *      `memory_db_relation_fact_ids_for_entity()`.  Cap fan-out per
 *      query at `[memory.graph_retrieval].max_facts_per_query`.
 *   4. Dedupe fact_ids; fetch the facts; emit as (facts, scores)
 *      parallel arrays.  Initial score = `entity_grounding_bonus`
 *      (configurable, defaults to 0.4 — above the 0.30 search floor,
 *      below typical strong hybrid hits).
 *
 * Layer: 2 (alongside memory_fact_search.h).  Pulls memory_types,
 * memory_db_entities, embedding_engine for query-time entity
 * resolution.  No LLM, no logging beyond OLOG.
 *
 * Thread safety: stateless module functions; each DB call acquires
 * the auth_db mutex internally.  Safe to call from any worker.

 * @brief Extract proper-noun candidates from @p query and resolve each
 *        against the user's `memory_entities` table.
 *
 * Heuristic candidate extraction:
 *   - Capitalized 3+ letter tokens (alphanumeric, apostrophe and hyphen
 *     allowed inside).
 *   - First-token question-starter filter (What/Why/How/Who/When/Where/
 *     Which/Would/Could/Should/Is/Are/Was/Were/Did/Does/Do/Has/Have/Had/
 *     Will) — skipped because they're sentence-initial and never proper
 *     nouns in question context.
 *   - 100% coverage on LoCoMo cat-3 questions per the May 2026 profile.
 *
 * Resolution: each candidate goes through `memory_db_entity_get_by_name`
 * first (exact canonical match), then falls back to alias resolution via
 * `memory_db_entity_resolve_alias`.  Candidates that match no real entity
 * are silently dropped (the resolver itself filters question-starters
 * and noise).

 * @param out_count Receives actual seed count, in [0, @p max]
