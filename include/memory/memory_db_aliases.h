 *
 * Stage 1-6 cascade per docs/ENTITY_MERGE_DESIGN.md §6.  Used at extraction
 * time, BEFORE memory_db_entity_upsert(), to short-circuit duplicate
 * variants of an already-known canonical.
 *
 * Stages:
 *   1. Exact canonical_name match — returns the canonical id (post-JOIN).
 *   2. Token-Jaccard candidate generation (drops candidates with jaccard < 0.30).
 *   3. Type filter (`thing` carve-out: matches anything; person/place/pet/org
 *      must agree).
 *   4. Embedding cosine (drops candidates with cosine < 0.50; skipped silently
 *      if the embedding engine is unavailable).
 *   5. Exclusive-relation + contact overlap (top 3 by partial composite).
 *   6. Composite + threshold band routing.
 *
 * Returns MEMORY_DB_SUCCESS with `out_resolution->resolved_id == 0` to signal
 * "no match — caller should fall through to upsert."
 *
 * @param user_id User ID
 * @param name Display name (filter-checked by caller before this point)

 * @brief Resolve a synthetic-self seed against existing canonical entities.
 *
 * Phase 1.5 Ckpt C entry point.  Drives the same cascade as
 * memory_db_entity_resolve_alias() but in synthetic-self mode:
 *
 *   - Stage 2 uses directional overlap (|tokens_a ∩ tokens_b| / |tokens_b|)
 *     instead of standard Jaccard so single-token candidates aren't
 *     penalized by the verbose synthetic seed (real_name + aliases).
 *   - The canonical_name='user' allow-list is pre-added to the candidate
 *     pool before Stage 2 (per the empirical scan documented inline).
 *   - The inbound is treated as is_user_self=true so user_self_bonus
 *     fires correctly during Stage 6 scoring.
 *
 * @p canonical_name should already be the canonicalized union of
 * real_name + alias tokens (the same shape build_synthetic_self_entity()
 * produces for the link-user-self dry-run).  @p entity_type defaults to
 * "person" — pass NULL to accept the default.
 *
 * Unlike memory_db_entity_resolve_alias() (which commits only at the
 * auto-merge threshold), this entry point surfaces the cascade's best
 * Stage 6 candidate at ANY composite band — review-band and below-
 * threshold hits are reported so the Phase 2 caller can make its own
