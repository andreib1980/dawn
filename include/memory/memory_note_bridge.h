 *
 * Memory→note bridge (Phase 9 of the notes/reference-text store).
 *
 * When a user files reference text as a note, the canonical text lives only in
 * the document store.  The bridge writes a thin "gloss" fact — a self-directing
 * pointer ("the user has a saved note titled X; retrieve it verbatim with
 * document_read") whose `note_doc_id` links it to the note.  The gloss is
 * semantically retrievable, so a fuzzy "what's my bio" surfaces it and steers
 * the model to the exact note, but it is exempt from paraphrase-dedup, prune,
 * decay, and pattern-delete (see the note_doc_id exemptions in the memory DB).
 *
 * The verbatim note body NEVER enters memory_facts — only the gloss sentence.
 *
 * Layer 2.  Save/WebUI callers (Layer 3/4) invoke these AFTER a successful note
 * save/delete, OUTSIDE any DB lock (embedding does I/O).  Both are best-effort
 * from the caller's perspective: a gloss failure must not fail the note op.
