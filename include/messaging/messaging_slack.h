 * Slack driver — public registration entry point.
 *
 * v1: DM-only, text-only, LLM-bound.  Connects to Slack Socket Mode via
 * libwebsockets client mode and sends outbound via REST chat.postMessage.
 * Same forever-conversation semantics as SMS / Telegram / Discord.
 * Single-workspace token install for v1; OAuth-per-workspace install is
 * deferred to a follow-up.  See docs/MESSAGING_CHANNELS_DESIGN.md §8
 * (Slack) and §13 Phase 4.
 *
 * Required Slack App configuration (operator one-time):
 *   - Create app at api.slack.com/apps
 *   - Enable Socket Mode
 *   - Bot scopes: chat:write, im:history, im:read, app_mentions:read
 *   - Event subscriptions (bot events): message.im, app_mention
 *   - Install to workspace; copy "Bot User OAuth Token" (xoxb-...) and
 *     "App-Level Token" (xapp-...) into secrets.toml
