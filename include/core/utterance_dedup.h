 * Cross-device utterance dedup — a content-free, session-keyed suppression
 * gate.  When the local mic and a nearby satellite hear one spoken command,
 * each session independently reaches the LLM and the user gets two answers.
 * This module gates that: the first source to call check() within a short
 * window wins and proceeds; any *different* session that calls check() inside
 * the window is told to suppress.  No transcript is ever compared — which also
 * catches cross-engine ASR divergence (Pi Whisper vs Jetson Whisper) and a
 * device whose ASR returns empty/garbage.  See docs/CROSS_DEVICE_DEDUP_DESIGN.md.

 *
 * @note Pre-init safe: because the backing window is static-zero before this
 *       runs, any check() that races ahead of init() is treated as disabled
 *       (returns false).  Do not "fix" this by adding an init guard that
 *       suppresses — fail-open is the correct startup behavior.
