# Satellite Pairing QR Protocol

This document specifies the `dawn://provision` URI scheme that DAWN's admin WebUI encodes into a QR code, and what a satellite client (currently Android) must do to consume it during onboarding.

The QR replaces the manual transcription of two values that an operator would otherwise have to type into the phone: the WebSocket server URL and the 64-character hex registration key. Username and password are NOT in the QR — the user still authenticates after scanning.

---

## URI shape

```
dawn://provision?server=<urlencoded-wss-url>&v=1#key=<urlencoded-hex>
```

Example:

```
dawn://provision?server=wss%3A%2F%2Fdawn.local%3A3000%2Fws&v=1#key=0123abcd...
```

| Field | Location | Required | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `server` | query | yes | Full WebSocket URL with scheme + `/ws` path. `wss://` strongly preferred. The daemon refuses to emit a `ws://` payload when it is itself serving TLS. |
| `v` | query | yes | Schema version. Only `1` is defined. Unknown values MUST be rejected. |
| `key` | **fragment** | yes | 64-character hex registration key, URL-encoded. Placed in the fragment so the URI cannot leak the key via HTTP referers, link unfurlers, or browser history if a user pastes it somewhere outside the QR scanner. Parse with `Uri.getFragment()` then split on `=`. |

The total payload sits comfortably inside a QR code with `M` error correction.

## Android intent filter

Register on the activity that owns the pairing flow:

```xml
<activity android:name=".PairActivity" android:exported="true">
  <intent-filter android:autoVerify="false">
    <action android:name="android.intent.action.VIEW" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.DEFAULT" />
    <category android:name="android.intent.category.BROWSABLE" />
    <data android:scheme="dawn" android:host="provision" />
  </intent-filter>
</activity>
```

`autoVerify="false"` because `dawn://` is a private scheme, not bound to a real domain. Other apps can in principle claim it; the OS chooser is the only mitigation at this stage. See the "Show before store" rule below for the defense-in-depth layer.

When DAWN has a real domain in production, migrate to Play App Links with `autoVerify="true"` to pin the intent filter to your signing key.

---

## Validation (do this on every scan)

Reject the URI — and surface a clear "Invalid pairing code" error — if any of the following are not satisfied:

1. `uri.getHost() == "provision"`
2. `uri.getQueryParameter("v") == "1"`
3. `uri.getQueryParameter("server")` parses as a valid URL with scheme `ws://` or `wss://` and a non-empty host
4. `uri.getFragment()` is non-empty and decomposes into `key=<hex>` with at least 32 hex characters

Be strict. A malicious app claiming the `dawn://` scheme would deliver malformed payloads — the chooser is unreliable as a sole defense.

---

## Show-before-store (required UX)

After successful validation, present a confirmation screen BEFORE persisting anything:

- Show the parsed `server` URL in full.
- Show the registration key MASKED by default (`••••`) with a "Show" reveal toggle.
- Provide explicit "Continue" and "Cancel" buttons.

Only after the user taps "Continue" should the values be written to `EncryptedSharedPreferences`. Never silently provision — if a hostile QR somehow reached the user, this is the user's last chance to bail.

---

## What happens after pairing

The stored `server` URL + `key` feed into the existing satellite registration handshake (see `dawn_satellite/include/ws_client.h` and the existing satellite protocol doc):

1. Prompt the user for their DAWN username + password (existing login flow).
2. Generate a UUIDv4 for this device, persist alongside the key.
3. Open a WebSocket to the stored `server`.
4. Send the `satellite_register` message:
   ```json
   {
     "type": "satellite_register",
     "payload": {
       "uuid": "<persisted-uuidv4>",
       "name": "Phone — <model>",
       "tier": 2,
       "registration_key": "<the hex from the QR>",
       "capabilities": {
         "local_asr": false,
         "local_tts": false,
         "wake_word": false
       }
     }
   }
   ```
5. The daemon validates the key (constant-time compare, server-side) and returns `satellite_register_ack` with a `reconnect_secret` for future reconnects.

---

## Security considerations for the client

- **Treat the key as a password.** It rotates only via operator action on the server; assume a long-lived secret.
- **Local storage only.** Keep it in `EncryptedSharedPreferences` (Android Keystore-backed) — never plain `SharedPreferences`, never the filesystem.
- **No analytics / logging.** Never include the key in crash reports, telemetry, or remote log uploads. Mask it in your own debug logs.
- **Clipboard hygiene.** If the user ever copies the URI out of your UI for support purposes, warn them that cross-device clipboard sync (Universal Clipboard, Gboard, KDE Connect) may retain it on other devices outside your reach.
- **No `ws://` over the public internet.** The daemon emits `ws://` only when TLS isn't enabled (local-LAN dev). On a remote-reachable server, refuse to register over `ws://` even if the QR specifies it.

---

## Versioning

If the URI parameter shape needs to change in the future, bump `v` to `2` and update both the daemon's encoder (`www/js/admin/satellites.js`) and this document. Old clients reject unknown versions per the validation rules above, which forces an explicit upgrade path rather than silent breakage.
